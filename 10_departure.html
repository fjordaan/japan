<h2>Monday 28 April: Departure</h2>
<p><i>From Kelly's diary:</i></p>
<p>Thank goodness for F. He managed to set the alarm last night for 5:30 giving
us plenty of time to get our packing sorted. I passed out last night,
seconds before my head hit the pillow. It was hard getting up, and it took
ages sorting out all our loot and clothes and books and stuff. We were all
packed up and out of the room just after 7am. The little old lady who works
here was on the desk and she bid us farewell and thanked us for staying and
gave us a warm smile and a deep bow. Put our shoes on for the last time and
trundled out the door with all our luggage.

</p>
<p>We decided to walk down Dogenzaki-dori for the last time towards Shibuya.
Its a lovely sunny day, lots of crows about and OL and SM on their way to
work. We take the shortcut through Mark City mall to Shibuya station, and
battle our way through the crowds. The bag I'm pulling on wheels is still
damn heavy as its full of the comics and book we bought. We're not sure
where to get tix for the Narita Express, but we ask at the first JR
information desk.

</p>
<p>We are very lucky, we will just have time to get tix and onto the platform
for the 8:09 train. I'm really relieved, because not all trains stop at
Shibuya and I had nightmare visions of having to struggle across Shinjuku
station. The train pulls up on time as is the norm and we trundle very
gratefully onto the train, park our luggage and recline in the airplane
style seats. There's a SM sitting opposite us, but we politely ignore each
other. It's an uneventful 1 and half hour ride, but we do get to enjoy the
scenic views from the train, as it was late at night and already dark when
we traveled this way last time. Saw lots of rice paddies and farmers
sloshing about.

</p>
<p>At Narita we check in and go through security, into the terminal and look
for a spot to have some breakfast/lunch. Its been a long morning already,
and I'm really disappointed to discover all the cool restaurants I'd been
reading about in the Narita Airport info book are actually on the top floor
of the building on the other side of immigration control. Rats. So we end up
eating in this horrible canteen style place, cold soba noodles and prawn
tempura soba ramen. Not great, but we were hungry. There is alot of smoke
hanging about too.

</p>
<p>In the duty free shopping we got two packs of these hectic looking seafood
rice crackers with whole dried squashed seafood in the crackers. One is for
F's office and one for the chaps at Toms Deli where I buy lunch everyday. We
also bought a box of Japanese style green tea sweets and a variety sweet
box. Later F has a cup of coffee and minds the luggage while I try to use up
a chunk of Yen that's left over. F is being really cranky about me spending
any money, so its best if I do it alone. I got some boxes of green tea
pocky, a kind of sweet pretzel that's 3/4 coated with a chocolate or creamy
flavoured fondant. The airhostesses from Malaysia Air were buying loads of
them, so I reckoned they must know something I don't. The Malaysia Air
ladies were beautiful, immaculate hair and nails, so elegant and with
fantastic wasp like waists. They were sandals on their feet and the uniforms
are highly patterned, looked a bit like batik.

</p>
<p>I also got some dried tuna chunks, like fish biltong, a bag of whole small
dried/deep fried crabs in their shells with sesame seeds stuck to them. And
a bottle of water for the flight.

</p>
<p>Our flight left on time, we managed to get great seats being so early, the
first row of seats in economy that give extra leg room. We were seated in
the middle of the plane, and we had a seat open next to us. It was a long
flight, watched Two Weeks Notice, a Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock movie,
also snatches of MacGyver, which was cringe-tastic and Frasier which was
really funny. Also saw The Emperors Club, with Kevin Kline which was awful.
Had to watch the films with English subtitles as all the movies were only
available in dubbed French or Japanese. Meals weren't too hideous, but far
from great and with an eternity between them. Most people slept on the
plane, but we made a point of staying awake. I played quite a lot of
solitaire on the games section of the console.
</p>
<p>Landed at Paris slightly early, got to admire the incredible design of the
terminal buildings. The wait to board the plane felt endless and we were
really tired at this point. The flight to London was quick and painless, we
landed shortly after 7pm. We made the fast time ever from exiting the
airplane to walking through our front door in an hour and a half. We were
home by 8:30pm. Incredible. Maniac taxi from Hammersmith to Ancill close,
the guy drove like a bat out of hell. Opened the door to piles of post and
familiar smells. Its so nice to home again. The gardens being putting in
overtime, everything's grown inches since we left. It feels like we've been
gone alot longer than 10 days. We only manage to unpack our loot before
passing out on the bed. We slept like babes.
