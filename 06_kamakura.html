<h2> Thursday 24 April: Kamakura. Zen temples and <i>shinto</i> shrines</h2>
<p>Fortune smiled on us in Kamakura... Rain was predicted (we had a tense argument about whether we should change our plans), but never arrived. Lovely weather all day, visibility good.</p>
<p>Must've walked over 20km and took over 200 photos today. <em>Exhausted</em>, but a very satisfying day. Followed route in our itinerary. Engaku-ji, Teiko-ji and Jochi-ji temples, Zeni-arai Benten Shrine, Sasuke-no Inari  shrine, Hase-dera temple and the Great Buddha. Architecture and artifacts amazing, gardens far more still. The most breathtaking gardens we've ever been in. Gnarled feathery maples, characterful plums, wispy bamboo, mighty  yellowwood and yew, enormous gingkos, serene camphors, soft, red-barked, straight and lofty cedars. Shrines carved into the cliffs.</p>
<div class="picture">

  <h4>Engaku-ji Temple</h4>
  <p>Largest of Kamakura's 5 great Zen temples</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0222.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Near the entrance. Low angle due to steep steps I'm still ascending</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0227.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Little plum trees</p>
</div>
<div class="picture">

  <h4>	Tokei-ji Temple </h4>
  <p>&quot;Divorce temple&quot; &#8212; In the days before women were allowed to divorce their husbands, they could find sanctuary in  the nunnery here. If they remained there for three years, their marriage was annulled.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0229.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>More gnarled plum trees. They're actually full of small green plums. The last of their blossoms (and those of nearby cherry trees) still litter the ground.
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0231.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0232.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>One of countless Buddha statues we saw during the day, all with flower offerings before them</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0248.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Beneath a tall gingko</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0251.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>The cemetery is on several levels up the hill, making for many views like this one
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0254.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Enchanting patterns of overlapping translucent maple leaves</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0255.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Amongst serene graves (one of them had no headstone, only a simple mound with an ancient little bonsai tree on top). I caught a whiff of cigarette smoke, which was suprising as there was no-one around...</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0256_mosaic.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>...then saw the origin of the smoke. An offering to the dead (see inset above). Many of the stately graves also had unopened tins of beer or soft drinks on them.
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0259.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Looking back down the sloping garden</p>

  <p><img src="med_set2/0262.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Bamboo groves behind above temple</p>
</div>
<div class="picture">

  <h4>	Jochi-ji Temple </h4>
  <p>From the sign at the entrance: <i>&quot;This temple is one of the five most prominent temples, ranking fourth on the list of Kamakura Gozan (Kamakura's Five Great Zen Temples). It was recorded that this temple was erected in 1280s by Morotoki, the grandson of Hojo Tokiyori, and established by a Chinese Priest. This temple possesses one of the Kamakura's Ten Celebrated Wells, the 'Kanro-no-ido' or 'Nectar Well' in the precincts.&quot;</i></p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0266.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Stairs ascending, and an avid Japanese photographer (wherever there are pretty blossoms, you'll find someone with a tripod)</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0267.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>The Japanese visitors are, if anything, even more enchanted than us by the remaining cherry blossoms. I can imagine the crowds that would've been there at the height of <i>sakura </i>season. Snowdrifts of blossoms still lie heaped on the ground.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0271.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0272.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Moss and bamboo textures
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0275.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Everywhere there are alcoves carved into the cliff rocks, with these little stone markers stacked in them</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0278.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Raccoon statues. You see these quite often</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0279.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>A tunnel carved through the cliff at one place
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0280_mosaic.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Some particularly beautiful grave markers</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0283.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>I loved this tiny weathered <i>torii</i> gate in front of an alcove in the cliff-face with a mossy little shrine in it</p>
</div>
<p>Forest path along a tunnel of trees with tree-roots as steps. The trees absorbed all sound and it was silent &#8212; the ground underneath was all firm clay, no stones or gravel. We never saw a soul, until at one shrine there was a large school group of noisy children. An 11-year old girl asked Kelly her name. Walking away, we heard her and her friend giggling and mimicking Kelly's way of  saying <i>konnichi-wa</i>. A large eagle swooped through the crowd, making off with some food. I was amazed, but nobody else was, but later I saw they were as plentiful as crows.</p>
<div class="picture">

  <h4>Hiking trail: Kewaizaka Pass in the Genjiyama Park</h4>
  <p>We had decided to take the hiking trail to the Great Buddha (which Kamakura is famous for), instead of taking the main route through the town first. We were still afraid it was going to start raining, but it never did.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0288.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Near the start of the path. Perhaps my favourite photo of the whole holiday.
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0291.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Tree-roots for a staircase</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0295.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Occasionally views of Kamakura (including the sea) emerge from gaps between the trees
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0296.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>School group at Kazuharaoka shrine
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0299.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Nearby, a headstone bathed in green light
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0300.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>This sign obviously shows the birdlife in the park. We saw the eagle at top left, which we thought was remarkable, until they proved to be as common as crows</p>
</div>
<div class="picture">

  <h4>	Zeni-arai Benten Shrine</h4>
  <p>&quot;Money-washing Benten&quot; &#8212; Benten is a general lucky goddess, but at this shrine you can wash your money in the well and it reputedly doubles in value. You reach it through a long tunnel dug into the rock, and then another tunnel of <i>torii</i> gates. Being quite dark, most of the photos didn't come out very well.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0307_mosaic.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Inside the cave shrine there are bunches and bunches of multicoloured origami cranes</p>
</div>
<p>The most beautiful shrine was the fox one (Sasuka-no Inari). Remote and quiet, with little moss-covered altarstones all over the place, with tiny white porcelain foxes and big moss-covered stone ones wearing red bibs.</p>
<p>Part of the walk was through unbelievably privileged/posh/pretty residential areas &#8212; a bit like Chiswick Mall in London. Inside one open garage was a large photo of a massive freighter &#8212; a shipping magnate's home?</p>
<div class="picture">

  <h4>	Sasuke-no Inari Shrine </h4>
  <p>From the plaque: <i>&quot;The first shogun Yoritomo Minamote of the Genji clan ordered samurai Shigetada Hatakeyama to rebuild this shrine in the 12th century. He believed that the spirit enshrined here was a harbinger of his good fortune. Five deities are enshrined herein. The annual festival is held in February.&quot;</i></p>
  <p>This was perhaps our favourite shrine in Kamakura. It's quite a hike from the main path, and there was nobody else there. </p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0317.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>After a long walk, you find the entrance <i>torii</i>...</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0318.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>...that just carry on and on for another 50m or so.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0322.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Everywhere the little fox statues face you with their red bibs
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0332.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>There are countless of these little shrines around the place, with burning incense and tiny little porcelain fox figurines</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0333.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>This is the general impression of the area. Like a temple without walls.</p>
</div>
<p>Somehow we managed to miss the route to the Daibutsu (Great Buddha) and reached the Hase-Dera temple first. Lucky, though, since we were famished and tired at this stage and had lunch in the temple pavilion with a 180-degree view over the coastal town and sea.</p>
<div class="picture">

  <h4>Late lunch at Hase-dera Temple<i></i></h4>
  <p><img src="med_set2/panorama_kamakura.jpg" width="800" height="253"></p>
  <p>Kamakura rooftops towards the sea. Many surfers in the water. This was the view in front of us while having our late lunch.
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0345.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Rice balls for dessert. One of our staple foods in Japan.</p>
</div>
<div class="picture">

  <h4>	Hase-dera Temple</h4>
  <p>Contains a shrine to Jizo, guardian of children &#8212; as a result the dominant feature of this temple are the crowds of tiny statues erected to children who had died. </p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0340.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Classic tree shape near the entrance</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0341.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Garden and ponds with carp and turtles</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0347.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>All the peonies we saw had umbrellas protecting them from the sun</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0348.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>The 1274 temple bell</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0346.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Some of the countless little statues to Jiro. Some of them have babies' bibs, or toys hanging from their necks. They commemorate babies that died, or were stillborn, or aborted. The effect is rather chilling.
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0350.jpg" width="540" height="405"> </p>
  <p>Rows upon rows of statues. The ones at the back are actually smaller, giving a sense of false perspective.
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0352.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>The garden, looking back. More umbrellas visible, shading the peonies</p>
</div>
<p>The Buddha was very impressive, clean and perfectly proportioned &#8212; a postcard-perfect image from every angle. Then we had a purple sweet-potato flavoured ice-cream cone, and caught a train into central Kamakura. Walked up the main boulevard   (getting directions from a nice rickshaw guy) to the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine.</p>
<div class="picture">

  <h4>Daibutsu (giant Buddha statue)</h4>
  <p>Cast in 1252, considered the finest giant Buddha statue in Japan</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0354.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0355.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>One of probably a thousand identical photos taken that day</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0357.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Light purple sweet-potato ice-cream. Delicious.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0360.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Those are all eagles wheeling overhead
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0362.jpg" width="540" height="405">Wakamiya-Oji, the central boulevard of Kamakura. Lined with cute shops either side, which we didn't have the time or energy for anymore.</p>
  </div>
<p>By this time the remaining temples were closed (and we were about dead on our feet), but we did see the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu courtyard, and the enormous 700-year old gingko tree.</p>
<div class="picture">

  <h4>Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine</h4>
  <p>Dedicated to the god of war, built 1063, approach path bridge between lotus ponds</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0364.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>The picturesque little stone bridge between the lotus ponds. Pine tree pretending there's a wind blowing.
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0365.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Temple grounds. In the background you can see the 700-year old gingko tree sticking out.
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0367.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>An assasination took place beneath this tree in 1219. It looks like a mountain. Even has wooden stalagmites hanging down from its gnarled branches.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0368.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>At all the Zen temples, you can have your fortune foretold with a small donation. You shake a metal jar until a stick with a number on emerges from a little hole. You open the drawer indicated by the number. Inside you'll find your fortune written on a piece of paper.  If you don't like your fortune, you can nullify it by tying it to this structure (as Kelly was forced to do the next day).
In the background, <i>sake</i> barrels.  </p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0369.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0370.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Beautiful vintage sake barrels. And at lower left, some boxes of beer from the local liquor store.</p>
</div>
<p>Then a <em>very</em> long walk back to Kita-Kamakura station.</p>
<p><a name="shabushabu"></a>Not the end of the evening yet! Exciting <i>shabu-shabu</i> dinner at Genkaya in funky and lively Harajuku area, but we had a hard time finding it due to unhelpful guidebook instructions.</p>
<div class="picture">

  <h4>Shabu-shabu dinner back in Tokyo</h4>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0373.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>You get as much thinly-sliced raw beef and vegetables as you can eat in 1&#189; hours (when anything runs out, you press a buzzer to signal you need replenishment), and a tureen of hot water with kelp for flavour on a hotplate.
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set2/0375.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>You cook your meat and vegetables and meat in the boiling water, then mix it nicely together in your little dipping bowl. (I'm not saying that's how it should be done, but that's what we did.) Addictive. </p>
