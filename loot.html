<div class="picture">
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0058_IMG.jpg" width="540" height="405"><i>Tetsubin</i> iron teapot, Iwachu brand, from the Oriental Bazaar, Harajuku</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0030_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0029_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Noritake crockery with <i>Totoro</i> designs. Seems really timeless to me, like it's centuries-old folklore already. </p>
  <p>The reed mats also have woven <i>Totoro</i> designs in the corner</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0043_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Set of 4 <i>Heidi</i> porridge bowls</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0012_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>What you drink your tea from in most places</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0016_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Three different tea caddies from bought at three different places, for three different kinds of tea we bought. All have a double-lid system, the inner one being air-tight. Both hotels we stayed in had ones like these, so that's how we decided we need them.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0034_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="449"></p>
  <p><i>Totoro</i> scarf</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0061_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Cheap fake laquerware and cooking chopsticks</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0067_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Toe-slippers, bought at a Senso-ji stall</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0068_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Fans from the Oriental bazaar</p>

  <p><i>Totoro</i> pins</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0008_IMG.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Homemade swallow pins from a <a href="01b_designfesta.html">DesignFesta</a> stall</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0016_IMG.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Heidi cards from Tokyo Hands</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0092_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Paper balloon/lanterns from the Oriental Bazaar</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0032_IMG.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Complementary matches from three different places we ate at. The little bamboo crab was bought from one of the restaurant supply shops in Kappabashi-dori</p>

<h3><a name="edibles"></a>Edibles</h3>
<div class="picture">
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0021_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Crabs in sesame seeds. I assume you eat them whole.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0052_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Dried tuna slices. (Already eaten; delicious)</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0053_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Seafood rice crackers.  Shrimps and things embedded in them like fossils. Here's a close-up:</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/101-0103_IMG.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Yum. See also the <a href="food.html#crackers">expensive version</a>
</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0086_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Dried squid, cuttlefish, octopus, that sort of thing. I (and especially Kelly) developed a taste for this after an ex-colleague brought back some after a trip to Tokyo 2 years ago. Love the logo, too.</p>
<p><img src="med_set4/100-0056_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>New leaf <i>ocha</i> (green tea).  Read more <a href="food.html#tea">here</a></p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0059_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>A different variety of <i>ocha</i>. This one's slightly toasted, I think</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0049_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Yet another variety of green tea (package in the background), which has little bits of puffed rice mixed in. In the foreground, a block of plum jelly you eat with a little plastic spade. The box underneath it is this intriguing sweet:</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0034_IMG_mosaic.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Red beans encased in translucent sugar, wrapped in gold-flecked rice paper</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0087_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Green tea teabags</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0050_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Various bits. Pocky are convenient little chocolate or mousse-coated wafer sticks. I'm not sure how widely they are available in the world, but my colleagues at work don't know it. The green tea flavouring is typical of Japan, though. Then little star sweets that look like dust bunny food (<i>Spirited Away</i>). Then green tea &amp; plum sweet, then chocolate bars, then pencil erasers that look like dishes of food.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0063_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>Package of 5 different varieties of <i>miso</i> soup. General-purpose chili-ish seasoning you find in all restaurants. And dried seaweed stamped into cute shapes.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0081_IMG.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Mango-flavoured boiled sweets, and sweet chestnuts. I liked the design on the back of the package (see red strip)</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0009_IMG.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>This is both an object and an edible. It contains  persimmon jelly, which you scoop out with a spoon, but the plastic container is meant to be kept and re-used. The pamphlet enclosed has several suggestions: a soup-bowl, a teacup, a plant pot, ...</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0094_IMG.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Rice crackers. The bead is a rice cracker with a peanut inside,  and printed designs on the plastic wrapping make them look like dolls.</p>

<h3><a name="books"></a>Books</h3>
<p>So why did I buy a lot of comics I can't read? Well, over the years I've bought many in Japanese, French, Italian, and other languages I can't read, mainly for the art, and the comic medium makes it still possible to follow stories in a rudimentary fashion. But I am hoping to translate some of these one day, whether I can get people to do it for me, whether I may one day learn the language, or perhaps <a href="http://www.quick-pen.com/quicktionary-II.shtml" target="_blank" title="Translating pen scanner. It helps that nearly all manga are typeset rather than handwritten">technology</a> will come to the rescue. In the case of famous authors like Miyazaki, fan translations are a real possibility.</p>
<div class="picture">
  <h4>Books by Hayao Miyazaki</h4>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0031_IMG_retouch.jpg" width="540" height="493"></p>
  <p>This is <i>Mononoke Hime</i>, or 'Monster Princess', an unsuccessful movie pitch that Miyazaki did in the early 80s, published in book form in 1997. It was a version of <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, and in various respects it anticipates elements of <i>Nausicaa</i>, <i>Totoro</i>, <i>Princess Mononoke</i>, and <i>Spirited Away</i>. <a href="http://www.tcp.com/~miyazaki/file-archive/miyazaki.ntrviews">Background information and synopsis</a>.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0040_IMG_retouch.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p><i>Hayao Miyazaki's Daydream note</i> [sic]. <a href="http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/zassou.html" target="_blank">Nausicaa.net entry:</a> This is a series of manga (or rather, "Graphic Essays") which Miyazaki has been (very) sporadically writing in a Japanese scale model magazine, Model Graphix.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set4/100-0038_IMG_retouch.jpg" width="405" height="539"></p>
  <p><i>Exhibiting Animation</i>. I was very pleased to get this as reading it provides a very similar experience to visiting the permanent exhibition rooms. It documents a special exhibition on Spirited Away at the museum, coinciding with its launch. Text in both Japanese and English.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0039_IMG_retouch.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p><i>Tiger Im Schlamm</i>, or,  <i>Otto Carius: Doromamire no tora</i>
(Tigers Covered With Mud). <a href="http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/otto.html" target="_blank">Nausicaa.net entry:</a> An all-watercolor manga based on Tigers In The Mud, the memoirs of Otto Carius, a German tank commander. <a href="http://www.mv.com/users/ctwilkes/Carius2/Episode_1/Carius_p147.html" target="_blank">Fan translation</a></p>
</div>

<p>Nearly all manga shops I've found only sell books sealed, which means you can't look inside before you buy. While this makes obvious sense for the storekeeper, I've always tended to base my purchases on in-store reading. So there was an element of chance in all the following purchases.</p>
<div class="picture">
  <h4>Other manga bought at Mandarake</h4>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0041_IMG_retouch.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>I don't know the name of the book, but it's by Fumiko Takano, whose <i>Tsuru of the Tanabes</i> greatly impressed me at the London Institute's manga <a href="http://www.digital.anime.org.uk/news/20011217.html" target="_blank">exhibition</a> in 2001. Unfortunately that story isn't in here, but it's a beautiful little book nonetheless.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0043_IMG_retouch.jpg" width="395" height="540"></p>
  <p>One of two books I bought by <a href="http://www.mangabonbons.net/au6/naito.html" target="_blank">Yamada Naito</a>, another one of my favourites at above exhibition. Her drawing style reminded me of <a href="http://www.lambiek.net/baudion.htm" target="_blank">Edmond Baudoin</a> (she seems to be very French-influenced, extending to the titles of her books.)</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0046_IMG_retouch.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p><i>L'amant</i> (1997) by Naito Yamada</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0047_IMG_retouch.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p><i>Falling into the sky</i>, by <a href="http://users.skynet.be/mangaguide/au1498.html" target="_blank">Murasaki Yamada</a>, a highly influential female manga artist, known for her poetic style and, unusually in Japan, feminist outlook. I saw <a href="http://www.miximage.net/manga_beyond_mainstream/bilder/weitere/murasakiyamada.htm" target="_blank" title="Shouwaru Neko, or The Malicious Cat">this comic</a> by her at the London Institute exhibition. I also read about her in Frederik L. Schodt's <a href="http://www.jai2.com/DL.htm" target="_blank"><i>Dreamland Japan</i></a>.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0049_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>This was a random find. <i>Love My Life</i>, by Ebine Yamaji. A subtle, sensitive story of a lesbian relationship. Beautiful art.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0040_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>A back issue of the monthly manga <i>Garo</i>, the mainstay of Japanese &quot;alternative&quot; comics (Murasaki Yamada was a regular contributor at one time.) 1994 was its 30th anniversary, all under the auspices of founder Katsuichi Nagai, who died in 1996.   The cover art is by Kiriko Na-Na-Nan.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0052_IMG.jpg" width="388" height="540"></p>
  <p>A random purchase, <i>F</i> (for Fantastic) turned out to be really good, with a nice mix of styles and some extremely interesting-looking stories. Includes a story by Naito Yamada.</p>
  <p>Update 17/5/03: also contains very good stories by <a href="http://www.yojira.com" target="_blank" title="His personal website. Some great content -- check sketches, illustrations. Even recipes!">Yoji Fukuyama</a>, Akihito Yasuda, Naoki Yamamoto, Jiro Matsumoto (excellent), Hiroyuki Yasuda (excellent), Mamoru Hashimoto, Shintaro Kago (excellent), and more. All names I'll be looking for in future.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0048_IMG.jpg" width="405" height="540"></p>
  <p>A 100-Yen store special. For fanatic fans of dachshunds (like Kelly).</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0017_IMG.jpg" width="464" height="405"></p>
  <p><a href="http://www.joehisaishi.com/" target="_blank">Joe Hisaishi</a> is one of Japan's foremost soundtrack composers. He has done the soundtracks for all Studio Ghibli's films, and many (maybe all) of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Name?Kitano,+Takeshi" target="_blank">Takeshi Kitano</a>'s. These are just from his Kitano soundtracks.</p>
  <p><img src="med_set5/100-0061_IMG.jpg" width="540" height="405"></p>
  <p>Hayao Miyazaki's <i>Kiki's Delivery Service</i>, Studio Ghibli. DVD.</p>
